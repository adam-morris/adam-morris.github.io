Welcome to my blog. I intend to post about my ideas and projects here. My to-do list indicates what might be coming up.

## To-do list
- Complete the fast ai course.
- Compete in a Kaggle competition (preferably with tabular data).
- Check the feasibility of using the Theta Network to run molecular dynamics simulations ([Folding@Home](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/the-foldinghome-initiative)).
- Try to build some simple smart contracts using Solidity in Remix IDE.
- Find and complete some simple Rust tutorials.
